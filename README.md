# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project – Stack Overflow Developer Survey
In this capstone project, I analyzed the Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset to uncover trends in the global developer community. The project involved cleaning and preparing large, real-world survey data, followed by exploratory data analysis to identify patterns in programming languages, databases, platforms, tools, and developer demographics. I used SQL and Python for data wrangling and analysis, and created interactive dashboards and visualizations to present insights on technology popularity, job roles, and salary trends. The final deliverable focused on data storytelling—translating analytical findings into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders to support technology and workforce decision-making.
